# # Retail Operations Inventory Dataset – Tableau Dashboard

This project demonstrates my ability to take messy real-world data, clean and structure it, prepare it for analysis, and communicate insights clearly through a Tableau dashboard. It reflects the same type of systems work I’ve done in retail, operations, and inventory-heavy environments.

Project Overview

The dataset comes from a large multi-acre retail nursery and landscaping operation. The original files contained inconsistent formatting, missing values, duplicated product categories, and multiple pricing fields. I cleaned and standardized it to create a usable, analysis-ready version.

The goal of this project was to show end-to-end capability in:

organizing and normalizing irregular data

creating a long-form dataset suitable for BI tools

grouping products into coherent categories

building a simple, clean dashboard to surface pricing patterns and category differences

presenting insights in a way that supports non-technical teams

Included Files

/data

inventory_longform.csv — cleaned and structured dataset used for the Tableau visualization

The dashboard focuses on:

category-level pricing differences

average retail price per group

a simple bar visualization optimized for clarity

Although it is intentionally minimal, it demonstrates the fundamentals: clean formatting, readable labels, responsible use of color, and the ability to transform raw data into useful insight.

Skills Demonstrated

Data cleaning and field standardization

Category mapping and consolidation

Restructuring wide-format exports into long-form data

Building a clear, readable Tableau visual

Basic operational insight generation (pricing patterns, category differences)

Version control and documentation using GitHub

Purpose

This project was created as part of a broader portfolio demonstrating my ability to support operations, customer-facing teams, and workflow-heavy environments through structured data, clarity, and organized systems. It reflects work similar to the foundational tasks required in roles related to:

customer enablement

operations support

data-informed decision support

internal process organization

product catalog or inventory structuring
